DarTuner
========

Real-time tuner (pitch detector) using Dart, WebAudio, GetUserMedia, and StageXL

Try a demo at: http://dartuner.dartvn.org/

Feedback appreciated.  Currently configured for C1-C7 - works well for 44.1k and 48k sample rates.

Browser Support
---------------
Works great on Chrome for Desktop
Some performance issues (memory leak?) on Firefox for Desktop/Mobile and Chrome Mobile
Internet Explorer 11 doesn't know about WebAudio API (you still get to see the spinning Dart logo!)
